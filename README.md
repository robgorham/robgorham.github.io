Rob Gorham: Learn, Experience, Teach


### Goals
---
* I want to use this site to experiment with as many technologies as I care to delve into.
* Learn how to deploy using a Static Site Generator
* See what all of this Jamstack stuff is about.
* Work on my soft skills by creating content



### Today I Learned #TIL

#### 6 - 29 - 21
* Implementing a blue / green testing environment is way more awesome.  My team has been a bit backed into this, and I am happy to have the permissions to at least do this.  Being previously siloed to UI intensive work and flexing my Azure Devops muscles is refreshing.  Looking forward to putting my stamp on some backend code next.
